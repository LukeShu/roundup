# Spray **roundup** on your shells to eliminate weeds and bugs.  If your shells
# survive **roundup**'s deathly toxic properties, they are considered
# roundup-ready.
#
# **roundup** reads shell scripts to form test plans.  Each
# test plan is sourced into a sandbox where each test is executed.
#
# See [roundup-1-test.sh.html][r1t] or [roundup-5-test.sh.html][r5t] for example
# test plans.
#
# __Install__
#
#     git clone http://github.com/bmizerany/roundup.git
#     cd roundup
#     make
#     sudo make install
#     # Alternatively, copy `roundup` wherever you like.
#
# __NOTE__:  Because test plans are sourced into roundup, roundup prefixes it's
# variable and function names with `roundup_` to avoid name collisions.  See
# "Sandbox Test Runs" below for more insight.

# Usage and Prerequisites
# -----------------------

# when needed (i.e. The Tomayko Method).  See
# [shocco](http://rtomayko.heroku.com/shocco) for more detail.
