roundup - kills shell eating bugs and weeds

roundup(1) is a unit testing tool for running roundup(5) test plans which you
write in any POSIX compatible shell.  Each test in a plan is run in it's own
isolated sandbox.  A test can pass, be ignored, or fail.  Failed tests output
their `set -x` trace.

Example:

  my-test.sh:

    #!/bin/sh

    describe "head(1)"

    lines() {
    cat <<LINES
    first line
    second line
    LINES
    }

    it_displays_the_first_n_lines() {
      result=$(lines | head -n1)
      test "first line" "=" "$result"
    }

    # silly test to prove failures are recognized
    it_displays_n_lines_from_the_tail() {
      result=$(lines | head -n"-1")
      test "second line" "=" "$result"
    }

  run:

    $ roundup my-test.sh

    head(1)
      it_displays_the_first_n_lines: [PASS]
      it_displays_n_lines_from_the_tail: [FAIL]
        ! ++ lines
        ! ++ cat
        ! ++ head -n-1
        ! head: illegal line count -- -1
        ! + result=
